= Description =
This  provides a sha3sum tool using go.crypto/sha3 in similar vein to other
tools such as md5sum, shasum etc. The internals of the Keccak-f function are
computed in go.crypto/keccakf.go used by go.crypto/sha3.
Refer to go.crypto/sha3 reference implementation for more information and refer
to Keccak web site (http://keccak.noekeon.org/) for detailed information on SHA3.
